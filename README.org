* My Emacs Configuration File
** Intro
This is my Emacs configuration repository, currently under
development. I frequently invoke the macro [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/use-package/][use-package]] to simplify my
Emacs setup, making simple to configure and load packages, and to
define custom settings and keybindings.

** Customization
When customizing Emacs through the menu bar (Customize Emacs) or
directly in your init.el, Emacs generates configuration lines that are
typically stored in custom-set-variables and custom-set-faces
sections. To maintain a clean and organized configuration, you can redirect
these auto-generated lines to a separate custom.el file, located in your
Emacs configuration directory.

** How Emacs Loads Configuration Files
Emacs loads several configuration files, and I will focus on the
following three:

*early-init.el*: If present, this file is loaded before init.el and
is used to perform early initialization tasks, such as setting up the
file system and environment variables.

*init.el*: Your personal Emacs configuration file, where you can add
custom settings and code.

*custom.el*: The automatically generated configuration file that
stores your customized settings, redirected from the
"custom-set-variables" and "custom-set-faces" sections.

** Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to review  [[https://github.com/Jpepetrueno/emacs-config.git][my Emacs configuration]]. I hope
it inspires you to create a personalized Emacs experience that suits
your needs.
